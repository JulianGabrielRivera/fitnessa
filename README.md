Welcome to Fitnessa

This app was made for people to be able to create their own user profiles and match with other like-minded people that are interested in fitness to improve both their mental and physical health.

Each user will have a likes and unlike heart, with the ability to be able to post comments on each user profile. This way each person can be held accountable for how consistent they are. They can also write about your personality, what kind of level workouts you do and just in general what kind of person you are so that other people would evaluate each other and then other people can decide if you are the right match for them to partner up and go to the gym with them. I also included filtering for the search bar if you are new or want to learn new workouts and depending on what kind of workout equipment you currently have or can get. In order to do this I used a JSON server to render a bunch of GIFS that have workouts for each individual muscle of the body.

The next update for this app would be to make it possible to match users that are within 10-30 miles of each other.

Thanks for stopping by, safe travels.
